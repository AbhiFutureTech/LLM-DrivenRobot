Do you think your task is sufficently interesting to be added as a new task for future task given that we already have the following task name and descriptions? Moreover, does the simulation code achieve the goal and the language descriptions in the task? Be as rigorous and high-standard as possible.

Reminder:
your task:
TASK_STRING_TEMPLATE

TASK_CODE_TEMPLATE

current task list:
CURRENT_TASK_NAME_TEMPLATE

=========
Here are some examples.

{
	"task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
	"task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "yellow-bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
	"reasons": "not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`"
	"add_to_the_task_list": "False",
}

{
  	"task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
  	"task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
  	"assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
   	"reasons": "the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete."
  	"add_to_the_task_list": "False",  
}

{
 	"task-name": "sort-blocks-by-zone",
 	"task-description": "Sort different colored blocks into their corresponding colored zones marked on the tabletop.",
 	"assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"],
	"reasons": "the task is not covered in the current list and is an interesting combination of zone and block objects." 
	"add_to_the_task_list": "True",
}

{
    	"task-name": "insert-cylinder-in-sphere",
    	"task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    	"assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
    	"reasons": "this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere.", 
    	"add_to_the_task_list": "False",
}

=========
Reply explain your reasons and then say True or False, formatted in a python dictionary, do not miss commas or add extra spaces.
