# Robotic-Tasks-via-Large-Language-Models

Welcome to the Robotic Tasks via Large Language Models (LLMs) repository! This project explores the integration of Large Language Models with robotics to perform various tasks efficiently and effectively. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, we aim to enhance the interaction between humans and robots, enabling more intuitive and intelligent robotic operations.

## ⚙️ Installation
  ``` 
1.pip install -r requirements.txt

2.python setup.py develop

3.export Robotic-Tasks-via-Large-Language-Models_ROOT=$(pwd)

4.export OPENAI_KEY=YOUR KEY.
  ```
 We use OpenAI's GPT-4 as the language model. You need to have an OpenAI API key to run task generation with Robotic-Tasks-via-Large-Language-Models. You can get one from here.

## Features

* Task Planning: Generate and execute detailed task plans using LLMs.

* Natural Language Commands: Control robots using intuitive natural language commands.
  
* Real-Time Communication: Enable real-time dialogue and feedback between humans and robots.
  
* Contextual Understanding: Use LLMs to understand and respond to context-specific instructions.
  
* Simulation and Real-World Applications: Test algorithms in simulated environments and apply them to real-world scenarios.

## Usage

The project includes various modules and examples to demonstrate how LLMs can be used to perform robotic tasks. You can run these examples to see the system in action or customize them to fit your specific needs.

 ```
python examples/task_planning.py
python examples/natural_language_commands.py
 ```
